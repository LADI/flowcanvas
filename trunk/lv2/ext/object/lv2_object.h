/** @file
 * This header defines the code portion of the LV2 Object extension with URI
 * <http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/object> (preferred prefix 'lv2obj').
 *
 * This extension allows hosts and plugins to manage dynamically allocated
 * 'objects' of any type (defined by a URI).  This is useful for large/shared
 * data structures (like images or waveforms) and for non-POD event payloads
 * (allowing plugins to process events too large/expensive to copy).
 *
 * This extension requires the host to support the LV2 URI Map extension.
