    doap:name "LV2 Objects" ;
	rdfs:comment """
This extension allows hosts and plugins to manage dynamically allocated
'objects' of any type (defined by a URI).  This is useful for large/shared
data structures (like images or waveforms) and for non-POD event payloads
(allowing plugins to process events too large/expensive to copy).

This extension requires the host to support the LV2 URI Map extension.
