	a lv2:Feature ;
    doap:name "LV2 Resize Port Extension" ;
	rdfs:comment """
An extension that allows LV2 plugins to request a resize of an output port.

Any host which supports this extension must pass an LV2_Feature to
the plugin's instantiate method with URI http://lv2plug.in/ns/dev/resize-port
and a pointer to a
<pre>
struct {
	void* host_handle;
	void (*resize_port)(void* host_handle, uint32_t index);
}
</pre>
where the plugin may call resize_port with the given host_handle from any
context to demand the resize of an output port buffer.  The plugin MUST call
this function from the context of the given port.

This function MAY return NULL at any time, plugins MUST gracefully handle
this situation.
