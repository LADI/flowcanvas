Lolep (LOw LEvel Plugins) is a collection of small, low-level LV2 plugins
to perform basic functions such as arithmetic.  Most are purely functional
and likely most useful for building larger components (e.g. in code, or in
a modular environment).

Lolep plugins work with the LV2 Object extension to work polymorphically
with any applicable data types (e.g. the sum plugin can sum controls, audio
buffers, controls and audio buffers, vectors of arbitrary size, integers, etc.)
