This repository contains several projects.  Most are related, and many have
direct dependencies.  They all share a unified build system (based on waf)
that can be used to build the entire repository at once, or each project
separately.  The /common directory must be checked out to build any
component, e.g. to build raul you need both /common and /raul checked
out into the same directory.  See INSTALL file for details.

*** IMPORTANT ***

You MUST clean your build if you want to switch between building the whole
repository and configuring each project separately.  If you mix the two
processes without cleaning BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

The top-level waf script provides a 'run' command to run programs from the
build directory without requiring installation.  The run command requires
a --cmd argument, and will set the necessary environment
(e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH) for running programs from the build directory, e.g.:

./waf run --cmd="build/patchage/patchage"
